; SOUND CODE AND DATA START HERE
;
; This looks like a predecessor to sound engines used in Choplifter, Pro Wrestling, Alex Kidd in M. World
; Song format is as follows:
; first byte is the number of voices (always 4 in this BIOS)
; then 9 bytes per voice:
; byte 0: flags byte:
;         * bit 7: if set, update the voice
;         * bit 6: if set, don't write tones to PSG (debug/dev flag?)
;         * bit 5: if set, we are in "tone ramp" mode (cf. explanation below)
;         * bit 3: if set, tones are encoded directly in the sound data (instead of using the tone table)
;         * bit 2: if set, disable all writes to PSG (debug/dev flag?)
; byte 1: low nibble = PSG channel mapping (e.g. if byte = $21, this voice is mapped to PSG channel 1)
; byte 2: duration multiplier; durations in the sound data for this voice are multiplied by this value
; bytes 3-4: pointer to sound data for this voice
; byte 5: offset into the tone table; added to tone indices in the sound data for this voice
; byte 6: index of vibrato curve to use +1; in this BIOS always 0 (no vibrato) or 1, as there is only
;         one vibrato curve defined in the BIOS data
; byte 7: index of envelope to use +1; in this BIOS 4 envelopes are defined
; byte 8: base volume of this voice
;
; Format for the sound data of each voice is a sequence of bytes with the possible following values:
; * $00-$7f: a duration value (in VBlanks)
; * $80: silence/rest (treated like a tone index)
; * $81-$df: an index in the tone table ($81 is tone 1, $82 is tone 2,...)
; * $e0-$ff: index to a sound routine/control flag.
;   Only $e0-$e5 and $e7 are used in this BIOS. There is code for $e6 and $e8 but seems unreferenced.
;   They are (with $nn representing an argument byte):
;   $e0 $nn: Set base volume to $nn
;   $e1: end of sound voice
;   $e2 $nn: write to PSG noise "tone" reg., and if %11 allow write to tone2 from noise voice
;   $e3 $nn: use envelope $nn
;   $e4 $nn $nn: jump current pointer in voice to the address provided. Used to loop the snail maze song
;   $e5: deactivate tone ramp mode
;   $e6 $nn $nn $nn: some kind of for loop using $e4 above (UNUSED IN THIS BIOS)
;   $e7: set VoiceSyncFlag to $80 (used to synch. sound with display of "MASTER SYSTEM")
;   $e8 $nn: add $nn to offset into the tone table (UNUSED IN THIS BIOS)
;
;   To trigger a song, write the song index + $81 at address $cf00 (SongRequest)
;
; About the tone ramp mode: it takes as inputs two tone values (base tone and delta tone) and a duration
; The sign of difference between the two tones indicates the direction of the ramp (if the difference is
; negative, the output tone value will go down over the duration, so the pitch will go up)
; Over the duration, the output tone will be interpolated linearly from the base tone to a new tone
; which has the same low byte as the delta tone, and the closest high byte that matches the direction of
; the ramp. For example:
; * if base tone = 0261 and delta tone = 004C, the output tone will go down linearly from 0261 to 024C
; * if base tone = 0261 and delta tone = 044C, the output tone will go up linearly from 0261 to 034C
